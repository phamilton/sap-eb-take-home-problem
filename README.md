The project follows a Controller-Service-Repository (CSR) design pattern, using Java Spring Boot Web for the implementation. Typically, the repository layer would utilize JPARepository, but in this case, since the data is being read from a CSV file, I have handled the logic at the repository level.

Strengths - Java Spring Boot is well-suited for this project due to its multi-threading capabilities, allowing it to efficiently manage heavy traffic.
Weaknesses - Compared to Python, Java can be less convenient for reading and processing data, as Python offers simpler tools for data handling and transformation.

If I had more time to dedicate to this project, I would explore other programming languages or potentially build a front-end to complement the backend functionality.
